This is the first SUE assignment

i. A brief write up (up to two paragraphs) discussing your understanding of these 3 maps and the way this data representation helps with your understanding of the trends.

All the maps represent the five boroughs of New York City. The maps are quantile representation. The first quartile which is white color means 0%-20%, the second quartile which is light blue is 20%-40%, the third quartile was slightly darker shade of blue is 40%-60%, the fourth quartile which is blue is 60%- 80% and the fifth quartile which is the darkest blue is 80%-100%. The fifth quartile represents the top percent of the data set. 


The first map shows that number of 311 complaints by regions. The darker the color, the more 311 complaints. The most 311 compliant was received from Bronx and upper west part of Manhattan and of upper part of Brooklyn. The least 311 complaint was received from Queens and Long Island. The second map represented illegal fireworks. Borough such as Bronx, upper west of Manhattan, central part of Brooklyn, and Long Island had the greatest illegal fireworks. Queens had lower illegal firework compared to any boroughs. The third map represented the number of illegal fireworks in ratio to 311 complaints. The greatest percentage of illegal complaints was received from lower Long Island, parts of Manhattan,  Brooklyn and a small counties of Queens. But all these maps suggest that 311 complainants, and illegal fireworks complaints were received across all boroughs.



ii. Do you have any ideas on how to improve this data visualization to be more truthful and insightful?

There is always a chance for improvements. This is my first time using QJIS software. I am learning about the tools of the software but I am still unsure of certain functionalities. Throughout the semester, we will be learning more use of the software and its tool which will help enhance my representation of the maps. Based on what I learned and while exploring the software on my own, I think I can improve the map representation by having my map layer on top of NY state map. This will help to more accurately determine and identify certain areas (cities) of the boroughs and the percentage of related 311 complaints, illegal fireworks and fireworks.
